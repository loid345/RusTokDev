# RusTok Catalog Mobile

Module-owned Flutter package for customer-facing catalog and cart storefront
surfaces.

## Purpose

`rustok_catalog_mobile` provides the first storefront mobile package in the
Flutter track. The package owns catalog/cart presentation and a small repository
boundary, while the host remains responsible for tenant, locale, auth/session,
GraphQL transport, and route wiring.

## Responsibilities

- Render customer catalog and cart screens for the mobile storefront host.
- Consume a host-provided `StorefrontCatalogRepository` instead of creating a
  package-local GraphQL client or locale resolver.
- Keep loading, empty, and error states inside the package so host routing stays
  declarative.
- Avoid admin/operator affordances in customer-facing surfaces.

## Interactions

- `apps/rustok_frontend_mobile` mounts `StorefrontCatalogScreen` at `/catalog`
  and `StorefrontCartScreen` at `/cart`.
- The host overrides `storefrontCatalogRepositoryProvider` with a host-owned
  repository implementation.
- Future transport-backed implementations must continue using shared host
  transport wiring instead of package-local clients.

## Entry points

- `lib/rustok_catalog_mobile.dart` — public package exports.
- `lib/src/catalog_repository.dart` — repository boundary and Riverpod providers.
- `lib/src/catalog_screens.dart` — catalog and cart screens.
- `lib/src/product_summary.dart` — UI-facing product/cart DTOs.
