# Architecture & System Logic

RusTok is a high-performance, event-driven modular monolith designed for enterprise content and commerce. It balances the developer productivity of frameworks like Rails (via Loco.rs) with the uncompromising performance and safety of Rust.

## 🛰️ High-Level Architecture

The platform is structured as a **Modular Monolith**. While all modules are compiled into a single binary, they remain decoupled through a central **Event Bus** and a **Module Registry**.

    subgraph "Data Layer (PostgreSQL)"
        DB_Write[(Primary DB: Normalized)]
        DB_Read[(Index DB: Denormalized)]
    end

## 🧠 Core System Logic

### 1. Multi-Tenant Isolation
Every request passes through the `TenantContext` middleware, which identifies the tenant (site/store) based on headers or hostname. All database queries are automatically scoped by `tenant_id`.

### 1.1. Request-Level Caching (Tenant Context)
**Current behavior (code today)**  
The tenant resolver middleware keeps a **local in-memory cache** (Moka) keyed by a **normalized identifier** (`uuid:`, `slug:`, `host:`). It uses a **TTL of 5 minutes** and a **max capacity of 1,000 entries**. On cache hit, the request avoids a DB lookup; on miss, it queries the DB and stores the tenant context. After tenant updates, the cache entry is explicitly invalidated so subsequent requests re-fetch fresh data.

**Implemented improvements**
- Normalized cache keys (e.g., `uuid:`, `slug:`, `host:` prefixes) to avoid collisions and simplify debugging.
- Added short-lived **negative caching** for 404 tenant lookups to reduce repeated DB hits.
- Enabled cache stats (hit/miss/evictions + negative cache stats) and exposed them via the `/metrics` endpoint.
- Routed tenant caching through the shared `CacheBackend` interface with an in-memory backend implementation.

**Distributed cache support**
- `CacheBackend` now supports a Redis-backed implementation (`RedisCacheBackend`) behind the `redis-cache` feature flag for multi-instance deployments.

### 2. CQRS-lite (Write vs Read)
To ensure maximum Performance on read paths (Storefront) without sacrificing data integrity on write paths (Admin), RusTok uses a **CQRS-lite** approach:

- **Write Path (Normalized):** Data is stored in 3rd Normal Form (3NF). Transactions and complex validations happen here. Optimized for safety.
- **Read Path (Denormalized):** When data changes, a `DomainEvent` is published. The `rustok-index` module listens and builds a "Flat" version of the data in specialized index tables. Optimized for blazingly fast queries and search.

### 3. Event-Driven Decoupling
Modules do not call each other directly. 
- If `rustok-commerce` updates inventory or pricing, it emits `InventoryUpdated`/`PriceUpdated` events (with `product_id` for index refreshes).
- The `rustok-index` module reacts and updates the search index.
- A notification module (if present) might react and send an email.

### 4. Module Registry
The `ModuleRegistry` is the brain of the system. It tracks which modules are compiled and allows for runtime toggling per tenant. Each module provides its own migrations, GraphQL resolvers, and event listeners.

## 🔌 API Architecture

RusToK uses a hybrid API approach to balance system tasks and domain-specific content management.

### 1. Hybrid Design
- **REST API (Axum/Loco.rs):** Used for infrastructure and system-level tasks.
  - Authentication (`/api/auth`)
  - Health checks (`/api/health`)
  - OpenAPI/Swagger UI (`/swagger`)
- **GraphQL API (async-graphql):** The primary interface for domain data and complex queries.
  - Modular schema via `MergedObject`.
  - Federated extensions (Commerce, Content, Blog).
  - Single endpoint: `/api/graphql`.

### 2. Service-Oriented Logic
Interaction follows a strict hierarchy:
1. **Controllers/Resolvers:** Handle request parsing, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and Tenant context.
2. **Domain Services:** Located in `crates/*`, these handle business logic, database transactions, and event publishing.
3. **Data Access:** Performed via SeaORM entities.

### 3. Standards & Documentation
- **OpenAPI 3.0:** Fully supported via `utoipa`. Schemas are derive-based, ensuring documentation always matches the code.
- **DTOs:** Strong separation between API Input/Response structures and internal Database models.
- **Error Handling:** Unified error types and GraphQL-specific error extensions.

## 📂 Project Structure Overview

| Component | Path | Responsibility |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| **Server** | `apps/server` | Main API entry point, route orchestration, and configuration. |
| **Admin** | `apps/admin` | WASM-based dashboard for managing content and store. |
| **Storefront** | `apps/storefront` | SEO-optimized public-facing site with SSR. |
| **Core** | `crates/rustok-core` | Shared logic: Auth, Events, ID generation (ULID), and Registry. |
| **Content** | `crates/rustok-content` | Universal content model (Nodes & Bodies). |
| **Commerce** | `crates/rustok-commerce` | E-commerce engine: Products, Variants, Inventory, and Prices. |
| **Index** | `crates/rustok-index` | Search and high-speed read models (CQRS logic). |

## 🛠️ Data Flow Example

1. **User** updates a Blog Post in the **Admin Panel**.
2. **Admin Panel** sends a GraphQL mutation to `apps/server`.
3. `rustok-content` receives the command, validates it, and updates the `nodes` table in **PostgreSQL**.
4. `rustok-content` publishes a `NodeUpdated` event to the **Event Bus**.
5. `rustok-index` receives the event and runs its **Indexer**.
6. The **Indexer** fetches the updated post, merges it with tags and author info, and saves it to the `index_content` table.
7. **Storefront** users see the update near-instantly by querying the fast `index_content` table.
