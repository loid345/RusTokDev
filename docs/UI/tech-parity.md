# Technical parity plan (Leptos + Next.js)

This document tracks **technical parity** between the Leptos and Next.js implementations (admin + storefront).
It focuses on shared integration points like REST/GraphQL, routing, SEO, auth, and error handling. The goal is
feature parity **in behavior and integration**, independent of UI design.

## Scope

- Admin: `apps/admin` (Leptos CSR) + `apps/next-admin` (Next.js).
- Storefront: `apps/storefront` (Leptos SSR) + `apps/next-frontend` (Next.js).

## Parity goals

- Same API capabilities and data contracts in both stacks.
- Same navigation flows, route guards, and URL structures.
- Same SEO strategy and metadata coverage where applicable.
- Same auth/session behavior and error handling.
- Accept small behavioral differences when libraries are not 1:1, but document them clearly.
- Keep the documentation current as Leptos libraries catch up with Next.js features.

## Integration parity matrix

| Area | Next.js (admin) | Leptos (admin) | Next.js (storefront) | Leptos (storefront) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST integration | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Align auth headers, error mapping, pagination.
| GraphQL integration | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Align query/mutation names and filtering semantics.
| Routing structure | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Match paths, dynamic segments, and redirects.
| Auth/session | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Match token storage, expiry, refresh, and logout.
| Error handling | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Standardize error codes → UI states.
| i18n | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Same locale list, fallback order, and URL strategy.
| Telemetry | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Same events, context payload, and sampling.
| Feature flags | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Same flag sources and gating logic.
| Forms/validation | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Same constraints, messages, and server mapping.
| SSR/CSR strategy | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Align hydration and caching strategy.
| SEO | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Same metadata, structured data, and robots rules.
| Auth kit helpers (`leptos-auth`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Use in `apps/admin`, `apps/next-admin`, `apps/storefront`, `apps/next-frontend`.
| GraphQL kit helpers (`leptos-graphql`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Standardize `/api/graphql` headers and request shapes across all apps.
| Form kit helpers (`leptos-hook-form`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Standardize form state + errors across admin/storefront.
| Validation kit helpers (`leptos-zod`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Standardize zod-style validation errors across stacks.
| Table kit helpers (`leptos-table`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Standardize pagination/sort/filter state across stacks.
| Store kit helpers (`leptos-zustand`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Standardize store snapshot/update shapes across stacks.

Legend: ✅ implemented, ⚠️ pending, ❌ not planned.

## Library parity notes

Leptos ecosystem libraries are younger and may lag behind the Next.js equivalents. We accept small
differences as long as they are **explicitly documented** and tracked.

When a feature is missing on the Leptos side:

1. Implement a **custom workaround** in code.
2. Add a code comment noting that this is a temporary custom implementation and should be replaced
   with a library-provided solution when available.
3. Update this document with the gap and a migration note.

### Current gaps / blockers

| Area | Gap | Impact | Mitigation | Migration trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _None_ | _—_ | _—_ | _—_ | _—_ |

### Resolved gaps

| Area | Resolution | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI primitives (Leptos) | `leptos-shadcn-ui` builds successfully after dependency alignment (including `lucide-leptos` + `view!` inference). | Keep versions pinned in workspace to avoid regressions. |

### Suggested code annotation format

Use a short, consistent marker near the custom implementation:

```
// PARITY: custom implementation (no Leptos equivalent yet). Replace when available.
```

## Implementation tables

### REST integration

| Item | Contract | Next.js | Leptos | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base URL | `API_BASE_URL` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Centralize via config module.
| Auth header | `Authorization: Bearer` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Reuse token key names across stacks.
| Error mapping | 4xx/5xx → UI | ✅ | ⚠️ | Align with shared error codes.
| Pagination | `page/limit` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Match defaults and boundaries.

### GraphQL integration

| Item | Contract | Next.js | Leptos | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client | GraphQL HTTP | ✅ | ⚠️ | Standardize endpoint + headers.
| Query naming | `users`/`user` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Keep identical filters and sort fields.
| Error mapping | GraphQL errors | ✅ | ⚠️ | Match user-facing messages.

### Routing

| Item | Contract | Next.js | Leptos | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Admin base | `/admin` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Align base routing and redirect rules.
| Users list | `/users` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Match query params for filters.
| User details | `/users/:id` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Keep ID parsing and breadcrumbs.

### SEO (storefront focus)

| Item | Contract | Next.js | Leptos | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Title/description | `meta` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Same defaults and overrides.
| OpenGraph | `og:*` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Same image sizing and fallbacks.
| Canonical | `link[rel=canonical]` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Same rules for pagination.
| Robots | `meta[name=robots]` | ✅ | ⚠️ | Same noindex rules for private pages.

## Review process

1. Update this document whenever a new integration is added or changed.
2. Require dual implementation PRs (Next.js + Leptos) for parity-sensitive work.
3. Add a snapshot or checklist per release to ensure parity stays intact.
4. Document any parity gaps and the intended migration path.

## Next steps

- Create a shared API contract reference (REST + GraphQL) and link it here.
- Define shared route maps for admin and storefront.
- Add a standard error code map and i18n keys list.
- Add a parity gap log (custom implementations + planned migrations).

This is an alpha version and requires clarification. Be careful, there may be errors in the text. So that no one thinks that this is an immutable rule.
