# Property-Based Tests Guide

> **Sprint 4, Task 4.2:** Property-Based Tests for State Machines  
> **Status:** ✅ Complete  
> **Framework:** Proptest  
> **Coverage:** Content and Order state machines

## Overview

This guide documents the property-based tests implemented for RusToK's type-safe state machines. Unlike traditional unit tests that use specific examples, property-based tests verify that certain properties hold for randomly generated inputs, catching edge cases that might be missed.

## What Are Property-Based Tests?

Property-based testing (PBT) is a testing methodology where you:
1. Define **properties** (invariants) that should always hold
2. Generate **random inputs** that satisfy preconditions
3. Verify that properties hold for all generated inputs
4. Shrink failing inputs to minimal counterexamples

### Benefits

- **More thorough coverage**: Tests hundreds of random cases automatically
- **Edge case detection**: Finds bugs with unusual inputs you'd never think to test
- **Shrinkage**: When a test fails, proptest finds the minimal failing input
- **Documentation**: Properties serve as executable specifications

## Implementation

### Dependencies

Added to `Cargo.toml` for both content and commerce crates:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
proptest = "1.5"
```

### Test Files

| Module | Test File | Properties Tested |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Content | `state_machine_proptest.rs` | 12 properties |
| Commerce | `state_machine_proptest.rs` | 16 properties |

## Content State Machine Properties

### ID Preservation Properties

```rust
/// Property: ID is preserved through Draft -> Published transition
fn id_preserved_draft_to_published(node: ContentNode<Draft>) {
    let original_id = node.id;
    let published = node.publish();
    assert_eq!(published.id, original_id);
}
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ ID preserved: Draft → Published
- ✅ ID preserved: Published → Archived
- ✅ ID preserved: Full lifecycle (Draft → Published → Archived → Draft)

### Tenant Isolation Properties

```rust
/// Property: Tenant ID never changes across any transition
fn tenant_id_preserved_all_transitions(node: ContentNode<Draft>, reason: String) {
    let original_tenant_id = node.tenant_id;
    // ... all transitions preserve tenant_id
}
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ Tenant ID preserved through all valid transitions
- ✅ True multi-tenancy isolation at the type level

### Metadata Preservation Properties

**Verified:**
- ✅ Author ID preserved through transitions
- ✅ Content kind preserved through transitions
- ✅ Parent ID preserved through transitions
- ✅ Category ID preserved through transitions

### State Transition Properties

**Verified:**
- ✅ Published state has valid timestamp
- ✅ Archived state stores correct reason
- ✅ Restored draft has fresh timestamps
- ✅ Status conversion is correct for all states

### Edge Cases

**Verified:**
- ✅ Empty archive reason is handled
- ✅ Long archive reasons (100-1000 chars) are preserved
- ✅ Update operation changes updated_at timestamp

## Order State Machine Properties

### ID Preservation Properties

**Verified:**
- ✅ Order ID preserved: Pending → Confirmed
- ✅ Order ID preserved through full happy path
- ✅ Order ID preserved through cancellation flows

### Isolation Properties

**Verified:**
- ✅ Tenant ID never changes
- ✅ Customer ID never changes
- ✅ True multi-tenancy for orders

### Monetary Value Properties

```rust
/// Property: Total amount is preserved through all transitions
fn total_amount_preserved_all_transitions(order: Order<Pending>) {
    let original_amount = order.total_amount;
    let paid = order.confirm().unwrap().pay(payment_id, method).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(paid.total_amount, original_amount);
}
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ Total amount preserved through all transitions
- ✅ Currency preserved through all transitions
- ✅ Small amounts ($0.01) handled correctly
- ✅ Large amounts ($999M+) handled correctly

### State Transition Properties

**Verified:**
- ✅ Confirmed state has valid timestamp
- ✅ Paid state stores payment info correctly
- ✅ Shipped state stores tracking info correctly
- ✅ Cancellation stores reason correctly

### Error Condition Properties

```rust
/// Property: Empty payment ID fails
fn empty_payment_id_fails(order: Order<Pending>) {
    let confirmed = order.confirm().unwrap();
    let result = confirmed.pay(String::new(), "credit_card".to_string());
    assert!(result.is_err());
}
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ Empty payment ID fails with error
- ✅ Empty tracking number fails with InvalidTrackingNumber error
- ✅ Error types are correct

### Cancellation Properties

**Verified:**
- ✅ Pending cancellation stores reason, not refunded
- ✅ Confirmed cancellation stores reason, not refunded
- ✅ Paid cancellation marks as refunded
- ✅ Refund ID is stored correctly

### Edge Cases

**Verified:**
- ✅ Delivered order accepts signature
- ✅ Delivered order works without signature (None)
- ✅ Tracking info retrieval is correct
- ✅ Common methods work in all states

## Running Property-Based Tests

### Run All Property-Based Tests

```bash
# Content state machine
cd crates/rustok-content
cargo test state_machine_proptest

# Commerce state machine
cd crates/rustok-commerce
cargo test state_machine_proptest
```

### Run Specific Property Tests

```bash
# ID preservation tests
cargo test id_preserved

# Tenant isolation tests
cargo test tenant_id_preserved

# Error condition tests
cargo test empty_payment_id_fails
```

### Run with Verbose Output

```bash
cargo test state_machine_proptest -- --nocapture
```

### Configure Test Cases

Set the number of random inputs to generate:

```bash
PROPTEST_CASES=10000 cargo test state_machine_proptest
```

Default is 256 cases per test.

## Examples of Edge Cases Found

While our state machines were well-designed, property-based testing could potentially find:

1. **Timestamp edge cases**: Very fast transitions causing timestamp collisions
2. **UUID collisions**: (Theoretically possible but extremely unlikely)
3. **Decimal precision**: Large monetary values with many decimal places
4. **String boundaries**: Empty strings, very long strings, unicode characters
5. **State ordering**: Unexpected state transition sequences

## Best Practices Applied

### 1. Strategy Composition

```rust
// Build complex strategies from simple ones
fn draft_node_strategy() -> impl Strategy<Value = ContentNode<Draft>> {
    (uuid_strategy(), uuid_strategy(), uuid_strategy(), content_kind_strategy())
        .prop_map(|(id, tenant_id, author_id, kind)| {
            ContentNode::new_draft(id, tenant_id, Some(author_id), kind)
        })
}
```

### 2. Property Isolation

Each property tests one invariant in isolation, making failures easy to diagnose.

### 3. Meaningful Assertions

```rust
// Good: Specific assertion with context
prop_assert_eq!(published.id, original_id);

// Good: Checking specific error type
prop_assert!(matches!(result.unwrap_err(), OrderError::InvalidTrackingNumber));
```

### 4. Edge Case Coverage

Explicitly test boundary conditions:
- Empty strings
- Very large values
- Minimum/maximum amounts
- Optional fields (Some/None)

## Integration with CI/CD

Property-based tests run as part of the standard test suite:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Run Property-Based Tests
  run: |
    cargo test state_machine_proptest --all
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Event Ordering Properties**: Test that events are emitted in correct order
2. **CQRS Consistency**: Verify read models match write models after transitions
3. **Concurrency Properties**: Test state machine thread-safety
4. **Performance Properties**: Verify transitions complete within time bounds

### Additional State Machines

As new state machines are added, property-based tests should follow the same pattern:

1. Identify invariants
2. Create generators for all states
3. Write property tests for each invariant
4. Document properties in this guide
