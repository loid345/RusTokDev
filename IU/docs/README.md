# IU Docs

This directory contains API contracts, usage guidelines, and examples for IU components.

- `api-contracts.md`: cross-framework props and behavior definitions.
- `admin-skeleton.md`: baseline admin layout and module structure.

This is an alpha version and requires clarification. Be careful, there may be errors in the text. So that no one thinks that this is an immutable rule.
