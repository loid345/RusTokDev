# rustok-commerce

## Purpose

`rustok-commerce` is the `Ecommerce` umbrella/root module for RusToK's commerce family.

## Responsibilities

- Provide `CommerceModule` metadata for the runtime registry.
- Serve as the umbrella entry point for the ecommerce family.
- Preserve the GraphQL surface while the Medusa-style REST transport expands.
- Expose the Medusa-style REST transport slice under `/store/*` and `/admin/*`.
- Resolve storefront cart line items from server-owned catalog/pricing data using `variant_id + quantity`, instead of trusting client-provided title and price.
- Orchestrate submodules of the ecommerce family through the compatibility layer.
- Own the checkout orchestration flow across cart, payment, order, and fulfillment submodules.
- Own store-context resolution across region, currency, and tenant locale policy.
- Apply channel-aware storefront availability on top of platform `ChannelContext` and `rustok-channel` bindings, without introducing a second sales-channel domain inside commerce.
- Apply shipping-profile compatibility between catalog products, storefront shipping discovery, cart context, and checkout validation, with typed product/variant bindings, typed line-item snapshots, and metadata normalization kept only as a backward-compatibility layer.
- Expose first-class `shipping_profile_slug` on product and variant create/update/read contracts and `allowed_shipping_profile_slugs` on shipping-option contracts.
- Expose deliverability-aware cart and checkout contracts with `delivery_groups[]`, typed `shipping_selections[]`, `fulfillments[]`, and typed `fulfillment.items[]`, while keeping the old singular shipping/fulfillment fields only as single-group compatibility shims.
- Treat nullable `seller_id` as the canonical marketplace identity key across product, cart, order, checkout, and fulfillment contracts, while keeping `seller_scope` only as a transitional compatibility field for legacy snapshots.
- Expose admin/manual post-order fulfillment creation over REST and GraphQL with typed `items[]`, seller-aware delivery-group consistency checks, and remaining-quantity validation against order line items.
- Expose partial item-level `ship` / `deliver` adjustments over admin REST and GraphQL, with per-item shipped/delivered counters and a language-agnostic metadata-based audit trail.
- Expose explicit admin `reopen` / `reship` fulfillment recovery operations over REST and GraphQL, so post-order delivery corrections do not rely on implicit status rewrites.
- Expose admin return decision-tree transport over REST (`POST /admin/orders/{id}/returns/decision`) and GraphQL (`createOrderReturnDecision`) on top of `PostOrderOrchestrationService`, so `return_only` / `refund` / `exchange` orchestration stays service-owned.
- Keep the module-owned admin UI as an aggregate operator workspace for shipping profiles, cart promotions, and post-order order-change actions; exchange/claim apply/cancel actions call `orderChanges` / `applyOrderChange` / `cancelOrderChange` instead of embedding domain rules.
- Own the typed `shipping_profiles` registry and validate product/shipping-option references against active shipping profiles before write-path mutations are accepted.
- Resolve the effective shipping profile as `variant -> product -> default`, persist it into cart/order line-item snapshots, and use those snapshots instead of live product metadata for checkout deliverability decisions.
- Expose admin shipping-option management over REST and GraphQL (`list/show/create/update/deactivate/reactivate`) on top of `FulfillmentService`, so delivery compatibility and lifecycle are configurable without dropping to direct service calls.
- Expose admin shipping-profile management over REST and GraphQL (`list/show/create/update/deactivate/reactivate`) on top of `ShippingProfileService`.
- Re-export the shared DTO/entity/error surface from `rustok-commerce-foundation`.
- Re-export `CartService`, `CustomerService`, `CatalogService`, `PricingService`, `InventoryService`, `OrderService`, `PaymentService`, `FulfillmentService`, and `CheckoutService` from the split modules and orchestration layer.
- Re-export `RegionService` and `StoreContextService` from the region submodule and umbrella policy layer.
- Keep commerce-owned orchestration code and leftover migrations not yet moved to new modules.
- Publish a module-owned Leptos admin UI package in `admin/` for host composition.
- Let the module-owned Leptos admin UI package keep the typed shipping-profile registry after product CRUD moved into `rustok-product/admin`, shipping-option UI moved into `rustok-fulfillment/admin`, order operations UI moved into `rustok-order/admin`, inventory visibility moved into `rustok-inventory/admin`, and pricing visibility moved into `rustok-pricing/admin`.
- Publish a module-owned Leptos storefront UI package in `storefront/` for host composition.
- Keep the aggregate storefront package transitional while split modules start publishing their own storefront routes, with `rustok-region/storefront`, `rustok-product/storefront`, `rustok-pricing/storefront`, and `rustok-cart/storefront` already owning their public slices.
- Keep `rustok-commerce/storefront` focused on aggregate checkout workspace concerns such as delivery-group shipping selection, payment-collection reuse, and checkout completion over a selected cart.
- Publish the typed RBAC surface for commerce resources.

## Interactions

- Depends on `rustok-core` for module contracts and permission vocabulary.
- Depends on `rustok-commerce-foundation` for shared DTOs, entities, search helpers, and errors.
- Depends on `rustok-cart`, `rustok-customer`, `rustok-product`, `rustok-region`, `rustok-pricing`,
  `rustok-inventory`, `rustok-order`, `rustok-payment`, and `rustok-fulfillment` as the default cart,
  customer, product, region, pricing, inventory, order, payment, and fulfillment submodules of the ecommerce family.
- Depends on `rustok-api` for shared auth/tenant/request GraphQL+HTTP adapter contracts.
- Depends on `rustok-channel` for platform-level channel bindings and request-aware storefront visibility rules.
- Depends on `rustok-outbox` and `rustok-events` for transactional domain-event publishing.
- Used by `apps/server` through thin GraphQL/REST shims and route composition.
- `apps/admin` consumes `rustok-commerce-admin` through manifest-driven `build.rs` code generation, with a module-owned commerce control room mounted under `/modules/commerce` for shipping-profile operations.
- `apps/admin` also consumes `rustok-fulfillment-admin` through the same manifest-driven composition path, with shipping-option CRUD and lifecycle now owned by the fulfillment module.
- `apps/admin` also consumes `rustok-order-admin` through the same manifest-driven composition path, with order list/detail/lifecycle now owned by the order module.
- `apps/admin` also consumes `rustok-inventory-admin` through the same manifest-driven composition path, with inventory visibility and stock-health inspection now owned by the inventory module.
- `apps/admin` also consumes `rustok-pricing-admin` through the same manifest-driven composition path, with pricing visibility and sale-marker inspection now owned by the pricing module.
- `apps/admin` also consumes `rustok-product-admin` through the same manifest-driven composition path, with catalog CRUD now owned by the product module instead of the aggregate commerce route.
- `apps/storefront` consumes `rustok-commerce-storefront` through manifest-driven `build.rs` code generation, with the aggregate checkout workspace mounted under `/modules/commerce`.
- `apps/storefront` also consumes `rustok-product-storefront` through the same manifest-driven composition path, with published catalog discovery now owned by the product module under `/modules/products`.
- `apps/storefront` also consumes `rustok-pricing-storefront` through the same manifest-driven composition path, with public pricing discovery now owned by the pricing module under `/modules/pricing`.
- `apps/storefront` also consumes `rustok-region-storefront` through the same manifest-driven composition path, with public region discovery mounted under `/modules/regions`.
- `apps/storefront` also consumes `rustok-cart-storefront` through the same manifest-driven composition path, with cart inspection and safe line-item decrement/remove actions mounted under `/modules/cart`.
- `rustok-module.toml` exports both surfaces through `[provides.admin_ui]` and `[provides.storefront_ui]`, so host wiring stays manifest-derived instead of relying on manual route registration.
- Declares permissions via `rustok-core::Permission` for `products`, `orders`, `customers`,
  `regions`, `payments`, `fulfillments`, `inventory`, and `discounts`.
- Transport adapters validate permissions against `AuthContext.permissions`, then invoke
  commerce services or direct tenant-scoped SeaORM reads where the module still owns the
  read-model assembly; post-order order-change preview/apply/cancel transport and
  return decision-tree transport stay backed by module services (`rustok-order::OrderService`
  and `PostOrderOrchestrationService`) rather than host-owned logic.
- Channel-aware price resolution is intentionally not part of the current storefront availability baseline and remains planned under Pricing 2.0.
