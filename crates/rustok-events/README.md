# rustok-events

## Purpose

`rustok-events` owns the canonical event contracts, schemas, and validation rules for RusToK.

## Responsibilities

- Define `DomainEvent`, `EventEnvelope`, and the event schema registry.
- Keep event validation and schema metadata independent from runtime infrastructure.
- Provide a stable compatibility path while `rustok-core` keeps transitional re-exports.
- Serve as the single source of truth for event payload evolution policy.

## Entry points

- `DomainEvent`
- `EventEnvelope`
- `EventSchema`
- `FieldSchema`
- `event_schema`
- `EVENT_SCHEMAS`
- `ValidateEvent`
- `EventValidationError`

## Interactions

- Used by domain modules that publish or consume typed RusToK events (including tenant lifecycle contracts such as `tenant.created`, `tenant.updated`, `tenant.module.toggled`).
- Works with `rustok-core`, which keeps compatibility re-exports during the transition.
- Used by transport-oriented crates such as `rustok-outbox` and `rustok-iggy` through shared event contracts rather than transport-owned schemas.
