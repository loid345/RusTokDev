# rustok-rbac module implementation plan (`rustok-rbac`)

## Scope and objective

This document captures the current implementation plan for `rustok-rbac` in RusToK and
serves as the source of truth for rollout sequencing in `crates/rustok-rbac`.

Primary objective: evolve `rustok-rbac` in small, testable increments while preserving
compatibility with platform-level contracts.

## Target architecture

- `rustok-rbac` remains focused on its bounded context and public crate API.
- Integrations with other modules go through stable interfaces in `rustok-core`
  (or dedicated integration crates where applicable).
- Behavior changes are introduced through additive, backward-compatible steps.
- Observability and operability requirements are part of delivery readiness.

## Delivery phases

### Phase 0 — Foundation (done)

- [x] Baseline crate/module structure is in place.
- [x] Base docs and registry presence are established.
- [x] Core compile-time integration with the workspace is available.

### Phase 1 — Contract hardening (in progress)

- [x] Freeze initial public RBAC runtime API: exported `permission_policy`/`permission_evaluator` + trait contract `PermissionResolver`/`PermissionResolution` with default use-case methods (`has_*`) for adapter-driven integrations.
- [x] Introduce shared permission-policy helpers (`permission_policy`) and start consuming them from `apps/server` extractors/service wiring to reduce server-owned policy logic.
- [x] Introduce shared permission evaluation API (`permission_evaluator`) and move allow/deny + missing-permissions outcome assembly from `apps/server::AuthService` into `rustok-rbac`.
- [ ] Align error/validation conventions with platform guidance.
- [ ] Expand automated tests around core invariants and boundary behavior (including stable normalized permission payload from both relation and cache paths).

### Phase 2 — Domain expansion (planned)

- [x] Implement prioritized domain capabilities for `rustok-rbac` (module now owns `permission_authorizer` use-case evaluation, relation-resolve orchestration via `RelationPermissionStore`, shared cache-aware resolver path (`resolve_permissions_with_cache` + `PermissionCache`) and runtime resolver service `RuntimePermissionResolver` with assignment contract `RoleAssignmentStore` (including role-assignment removal operations); `apps/server` consumes module runtime resolver instead of local `ServerPermissionResolver`).
- [x] Move authz rollout mode contract (`RbacAuthzMode` for `relation_only`/`dual_read`) into `rustok-rbac` to reduce server-owned RBAC control-plane logic.
- [x] Move dual-read legacy-vs-relation comparison logic (`shadow_decision`) into `rustok-rbac` so `apps/server` keeps only transport/observability concerns for shadow-check execution.
- [x] Add module-level dual-read orchestrator (`shadow_dual_read::evaluate_dual_read`) so `apps/server` does not keep local branching for `skip/compare` dual-read outcomes.
- [ ] Standardize cross-module integration points and events.
- [ ] Document ownership and release gates for new capabilities.

### Phase 3 — Productionization (planned)

- [ ] Finalize rollout and migration strategy for incremental adoption.
- [ ] Complete security/tenancy/rbac checks relevant to the module.
- [ ] Validate observability, runbooks, and operational readiness.

## Tracking and updates

When updating `rustok-rbac` architecture, API contracts, tenancy behavior, routing,
or observability expectations:

1. Update this file first.
2. Update `crates/rustok-rbac/README.md` and `crates/rustok-rbac/docs/README.md` when public behavior changes.
3. Update `docs/index.md` links if documentation structure changes.
4. If module responsibilities change, update `docs/modules/registry.md` accordingly.
