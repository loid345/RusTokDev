# rustok-rbac

## Purpose

`rustok-rbac` owns the Casbin-backed authorization runtime for RusToK.

## Responsibilities

- Provide `RbacModule` metadata for the runtime registry.
- Resolve effective permissions from relation data.
- Evaluate permission checks through the single live Casbin engine.
- Publish the typed `settings:*` and `logs:*` platform-admin surface used by server adapters.

## Interactions

- Depends on `rustok-core` for permission vocabulary and module contracts.
- Used by `apps/server` through `RbacService`, RBAC extractors, and permission-aware
  `SecurityContext` creation.
- Other runtime modules do not need a direct dependency on `rustok-rbac`; they publish typed
  permissions via `rustok-core`, and server transport layers enforce them through this module.
- Manual role-based authorization in `apps/server` is not part of the live contract.

## Entry points

- `RbacModule`
- `RuntimePermissionResolver`
- `PermissionResolver`
- `authorize_permission`
- `authorize_any_permission`
- `authorize_all_permissions`
- `has_effective_permission_in_set`
