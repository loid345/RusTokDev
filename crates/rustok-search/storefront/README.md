# rustok-search-storefront

Leptos storefront UI package for the `rustok-search` module.

## Responsibilities

- Exposes the search storefront root view used by `apps/storefront`.
- Keeps search-specific storefront UX inside the module package.
- Participates in the manifest-driven UI composition path through `rustok-module.toml`.
- Keeps the crate root wiring-only: `src/lib.rs` declares `core`, `transport`, and `ui`, while `src/ui/leptos.rs` owns the Leptos render adapter for `SearchView`.
- Provides the baseline route/slot scaffold for query input, suggestions, filters, and results.
- Keeps storefront results summary, preset, locale, item, source, score, and snippet presentation in framework-agnostic core view-model helpers so the Leptos layer renders prepared fields and host click actions.
- Uses native Leptos `#[server]` entry points in parallel with the existing GraphQL transport.
- Ships package-owned `storefront/locales/en.json` and `storefront/locales/ru.json` bundles declared through `[provides.storefront_ui.i18n]`.

## Entry Points

- `SearchView` — root storefront view rendered from the host storefront slot registry.

## Interactions

- Consumed by `apps/storefront` via manifest-driven `build.rs` code generation.
- Uses the shared `UiRouteContext` to read query-string state without leaking host-specific routing details, including locale-aware generic module routes.
- Runtime data access is native-first with GraphQL fallback; GraphQL is retained and not removed.
- Will remain aligned with the future Next storefront package on the same API/query model.
- Reads the effective locale from `UiRouteContext.locale` for visible chrome, empty states, and result helper copy.

- See [platform docs](../../../docs/index.md).
