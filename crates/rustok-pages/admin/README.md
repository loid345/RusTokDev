# rustok-pages-admin

## Purpose

`rustok-pages-admin` publishes the Leptos admin root page for the `rustok-pages` module.

## Responsibilities

- Export the module-owned `PagesAdmin` root component for `apps/admin`.
- Keep pages-specific admin UI inside the module boundary instead of `apps/admin`.
- Act as the canonical working admin vertical slice for module-owned page CRUD.
- Expose contract-safe page-builder capability surfaces (`preview/tree/properties/publish`) on top of the vendor-neutral `grapesjs_v1` backend payload.
- Keep write-path error handling consistent (`validation/sanitize/runtime`) for page-builder flows.
- Host the owner-side page SEO panel through `rustok-seo-admin-support` instead of delegating page metadata editing to `rustok-seo-admin`.

## Interactions

- Used by `apps/admin` through manifest-driven generated wiring.
- Uses the pages module GraphQL contract for list/create/edit/update/publish/delete flows.
- Writes visual builder payload into `body.contentJson` with `body.format = grapesjs_v1` while preserving legacy `blocks` compatibility.
- Uses the shared `rustok-seo` GraphQL contract through `rustok-seo-admin-support` for explicit page SEO authoring.
- Follows the generic host route contract `/modules/:module_slug`.
