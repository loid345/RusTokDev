# rustok-inventory

## Purpose

`rustok-inventory` is the default inventory submodule of the `Ecommerce` family.

## Responsibilities

- Own the inventory service, backend admin read-side service, native admin stock write helpers, stock-level migrations, and normalized stock and reservation persistence.
- Keep `stock_locations`, `inventory_items`, `inventory_levels`, and `reservation_items`
  as the source of truth for ecommerce inventory runtime.
- Provide `AdminInventoryReadService` as the inventory-owned backend read model for admin
  product, variant, price, stock, and translation visibility.
- Provide a module-owned Leptos admin UI package in `admin/` for inventory visibility,
  low-stock triage, stock-health inspection, and targeted set-quantity corrections.

## Interactions

- Depends on `rustok-commerce-foundation` for shared commerce DTOs, entities, and errors.
- Depends on `rustok-product` data model through variant references.
- Used by `rustok-commerce` as the umbrella/root module of the ecommerce family.
- `apps/admin` consumes `rustok-inventory-admin` through manifest-driven composition;
  the admin package now uses native Leptos server functions backed by
  `AdminInventoryReadService` as the primary read transport, keeps the transitional commerce
  GraphQL adapter as a read-only compatibility fallback, and uses native inventory-owned
  set/adjust quantity write endpoints for targeted stock corrections while remaining write
  parity is split from the umbrella commerce surface.
