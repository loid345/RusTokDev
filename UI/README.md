# IU

Internal UI  workspace for shared design tokens and parallel component implementations.

## Structure

- `tokens/`: design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows, themes).
- `next/`: Next.js (React) component implementation.
- `leptos/`: Leptos (Rust) component implementation.
- `docs/`: component API contracts and usage guidelines.

## Component scope (initial list)

- Button
- Input
- Textarea
- Select
- Checkbox
- Switch
- Badge / Tag
- Table
- Modal / Dialog
- Toast / Notification
- Sidebar / Navigation
- Header / Topbar

## Principles

- Keep API parity across Next and Leptos components.
- Base styling on shared tokens and support light/dark themes.
- Avoid direct duplication of shadcn by treating it as a reference for Next only.

This is an alpha version and requires clarification. Be careful, there may be errors in the text. So that no one thinks that this is an immutable rule.
