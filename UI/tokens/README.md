# Tokens

Design tokens live here (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows, and themes).

- `base.css`: minimal token set aligned to shadcn defaults (HSL values) with light/dark themes.
- Consumers should map these to framework-specific styling systems.

This is an alpha version and requires clarification. Be careful, there may be errors in the text. So that no one thinks that this is an immutable rule.
